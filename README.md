Mini Games

The MiniGames project, is part of the subject Software Development 2 at Hochschule der Medien in Stuttgart.
The project consists of 2 games (Hangman and Mine Sweeper) and should fulfill some criteria like, it should contain GUI, 
work with interfaces, Logging, Exceptions, and more. 

In the Hangman game we have two possibilities. One is a single player mode, where the person plays with the machine and
tries to guess the word chosen by the algorithm within three levels: Easy, Medium, Hard. The second mode is the 
multiplayer, where each player picks the opponent's word. 

The player input can only be one letter (uppercase or lowercase) of the English alphabet. Therefore, numbers and 
characters such as: @, ÃŸ are not allowed. Furthermore, the player has up to 10 attempts, in both modes (multi or 
single player) to get the word right, otherwise the player will lose the game.

In the game minesweeper the mines are hidden in a grid of squares. Safe squares have numbers telling the player how many 
mines are touching the square. The player can use the number clue to solve the game by opening the safe squares. 
If the player clicks on a mine you lose the game!
